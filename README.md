## Expected Result

When a card's title is updated, it should only update that card and any cards that it's a child of.

## Actual Result

Changing a card's title updates that card as well as any card that has a child.

## Additional Details

- There are console logs indicating which cards are being updated.
- Sorry for the terrible UI.
